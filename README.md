NOTICE:

I do not claim to be the creator or owner of this CyanogenMod SGT7 11 (Android 4.4.3 based) ROM
for the Kindle Fire 1st Generation. This is the work of Hashcode, SGT7 developers, the
CyanogenMod team, and a few others. I merely removed a few /system/app and /system/priv-app/
APK files because I did not want that bloatware for myself. 


You can download the signed ROM zip in the Releases tab, but I have not tested this ROM at all 
and it is likely to not work, so I don't suggest that you try it. Just flash the normal CM11
zip and remove the bloatware manually.

I cannot test this ROM edit because my Kindle Fire is broken, unfourtanetly. I would
love to know if it works, though.
