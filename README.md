You can download the signed ROM zip in the Releases tab, but I have **not tested** this ROM at all 
and it is likely to not work, **so I don't suggest that you try it**. Just flash the normal CM11
zip and remove the bloatware manually.

NOTICE:

I do not claim to be the creator or owner of this CyanogenMod SGT7 11 (Android 4.4.3 based) ROM
for the Kindle Fire 1st Generation. This is the work of Hashcode, SGT7 developers, the
CyanogenMod team, and a few others. I merely removed a few /system/app and /system/priv-app/
APK files because I did not want that bloatware for myself. 

I cannot test this ROM edit because my Kindle Fire is broken, unfourtanetly. I would
love to know if it works, though.



I will not post the pre-build source code because this is a modification of the post-build flashable .zip and there is no point in posting it because of that. You can find the source code used by the original builder at these links:
